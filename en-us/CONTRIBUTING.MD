So you like this modpack and want to support it? That's great! In this page I have listed the ways you can contribute.

* **[Download the pack from Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/fabulously-optimized/files)** - seriously, that is the easiest thing that helps the modpack and its mods the most. Every download contributes to the [Curseforge rewards system](https://support.curseforge.com/en/support/solutions/articles/9000197898-rewards-program-terms-of-service#1.-Description-of-Rewards-Program), meaning both the modpack dev and the modders can get monetary rewards. Don't forget to share it with others as well!
  * More specifically, using 
     * the Curseforge Launcher
     * MultiMC (when downloaded via the CF site) 
     * vanilla launcher (when downloaded MultiMC via the CF site) 
  * support the pack, other launchers/methods unfortunately do not.
* **Donate to the mods**, for example:
  * [JellySquid](https://jellysquid.me/donate), the developer of Sodium/Lithium/Phosphor/Hydrogen
  * [coderbot](https://www.patreon.com/coderbot), the developer of Iris Shaders 
  * [FlashyReese](https://ko-fi.com/flashyreese), the developer of Sodium Extra 
  * For other mods, see their respective pages.
* **Contribute to mods** - simple things like suggesting features, reporting bugs when you encounter an issue and [translating your language](./language-support.md) really do help out the mods. You can translate Fabulously Optimized's Mod Menu Helper as well!
* **Give feedback to the pack** - giving your ideas on what to add or change about the pack makes sure that we all can get the best quality out of it. Mod suggestions and bugs [can be posted to issues here](https://github.com/Madis0/fabulously-optimized/issues) and general questions are expected on [Discord](https://discord.gg/yxaXtaQqdB).
* **Contribute to FO toolkit** - know some Python? Feel free to improve my scripts by forking and making a pull request.
* **Create a Minecraft server** - [my BisectHosting affiliate link](https://www.bisecthosting.com/clients/aff.php?aff=2604) will give you 25% off for the first month. Having more users there can give the modpack dev some monetary benefits similar to CF rewards.
* **Want to make a mod for FO?**
  Currently I am looking for:
  * Optifine's emissive block textures support
  * Optifine's custom sky/clouds support
