One of the goals of Fabulously Optimized is to provide feature parity with [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/home), in order to make it easier for users to transition away from it. 

Here is the list of OptiFine features that are supported in this modpack:

* Performance optimizations - [Sodium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium), [Lithium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lithium), [Starlight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/starlight) [etc.](https://github.com/Madis0/fabulously-optimized#smooth)

¹ Snow is opt-in in settings as it changes some textures too, making it weird with some resource packs.
² Not identical to OptiFine as people did not prefer the look. If you want it to be identical, [disable this mod](./disabling-mods.md), [install](./adding-more-mods.md) the original [Cull Leaves](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cull-leaves), enable its bundled resource pack and disable "Use Block Face Culling" in video settings.

Additionally, you can enjoy:

* [better overall performance](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized#smooth)
* better mod compatibility
* [easy installation](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized#downloads) for various launchers
* [some extra features](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized#included-mods) OptiFine does not provide

Parity with OptiFine is an ongoing process. If you're interested in what's coming, [see this list](https://github.com/Madis0/fabulously-optimized/issues?q=is:issue%20is:open%20label:parity).
