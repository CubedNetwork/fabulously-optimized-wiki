The modpack [is already configured](https://github.com/Madis0/fabulously-optimized/wiki/Changed-options) for the best performance and simplest experience for most users.
However, you may want to configure things like dynamic lights, fog distance and cloud height - for that:
1. Click `Mods`
1. Read the descriptions of the mods to see what they do
1. If the pencil is blue, you can configure the mod by clicking the config button ![](https://i.ibb.co/j35cBtn/image.png)
   * If you don't see any pencils, you don't have the Mod Menu Helper resource pack enabled for some reason.  
       1. Click `Done` -> `Options...` -> `Resource Packs...` -> `⏵` on "Mod Menu Helper.zip" -> `Done` -> go to point 1 of this tutorial

If you need to disable a mod, [see this wiki page](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/wiki/Disabling-mods).
