I am aware that since Fabulously Optimized was created, several similar packs have started appearing on Curseforge. So what separates this from the rest?

* **Transparency** - Fabulously Optimized is [open source](https://github.com/Madis0/fabulously-optimized/blob/main/LICENSE), [documented](https://github.com/Madis0/fabulously-optimized/wiki), [changes are outlined](https://github.com/Madis0/fabulously-optimized/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md), [mods are clearly listed](https://github.com/Madis0/fabulously-optimized#included-mods) with their creator and purpose.
* **Community** and collaboration - Fabulously Optimized is developed with the community, [helping you fix problems](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/fabulously-optimized#reply), [considering your mod suggestions](https://github.com/Madis0/fabulously-optimized/issues) and [even reverting changes if they were not popular](https://github.com/Madis0/fabulously-optimized/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#131). I also contribute to the mods themselves by reporting issues and PRing fixes.
* **Consistency** aka Less is More - Fabulously Optimized must be sustainable, 100% server-compatible and it should work similarly across versions. I carefully consider every new mod and change I include to make sure it would work well, look vanilla and be available in the future.
* **Neutrality** - there are many small mods that I can recommend to improve Minecraft in various ways, but cannot add to this modpack as they don't feel "neutral" enough, I avoid extras that seem to go too far from vanilla behaviours
* **Familiarity** and parity - main priority is having parity with Optifine, but sometimes Forge, Bedrock Edition and snapshots are considered as well
* **Availability** - I support Curseforge Launcher, MultiMC, GDLauncher and even Minecraft Launcher (vanilla), better vanilla support and Modrinth are coming in the future.
* **Updates** - Fabulously Optimized is meant to work on the latest stable version of Minecraft: Java Edition using the best mods available for it.
